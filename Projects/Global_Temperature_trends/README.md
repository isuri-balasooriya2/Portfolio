This project is a basic level data analysis project on prescriptive data analytics.

Prescriptive data analytics is build on descriptive and predictive data analytics. It focuses on the future rather than the past. In this project I have used the global temperature dataset from Berkeley University â€” https://berkeley-earth-temperature.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Global/Land_and_Ocean_complete.txt.

- Start with collecting data and loading into a usable format
