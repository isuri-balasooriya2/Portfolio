This project is a basic level predictive data analytics on NY Times Books API
- Data Collection using API
- Loop through multiple weeks of best selling lists to build a dataset and save in a csv file
- Data cleaning and formatting using pandas
- Data visualization using matplotlib

I hope to improve this project further with more predictive modelling, scikit-learn library and other tools.
