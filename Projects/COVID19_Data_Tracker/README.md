In this project I have done a diagnostic data analytics using a COVID-19 dataset.

I have taken the following steps to complete this project,
- Data collection and basic data cleaning using power query.
- Importing the data in csv format to Python.
- Data cleaning and formatting using pandas.
- Data visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly
- Dashboard using Power BI

The main objective of the project was to find answers to the following questions,
- What were the time periods where COVID-19 cases surged significantly in selected countries?
- Did a reduction in testing or changes in test positivity rates precede or coincide with the spike?
- What was the vaccination rate during the case spike?
- How did government response (stringency index) change before and during the spike?
- Were there any noticeable correlations between multiple factors and spikes?
- Did the trends differ across countries, or were there common patterns?
