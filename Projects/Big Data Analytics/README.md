🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis (with Dask)
This project analyzes the global impact of COVID-19 using large-scale datasets and Python's Dask library. It demonstrates how big data tools can be used for data analysis on a standard machine.

🔍 Project Goals
Load and process a large COVID-19 dataset using Dask

Perform country-level comparisons on:

Case counts

Death rates

Vaccination rates

Government response (Stringency Index)

Visualize key trends and relationships

🛠 Tech Stack
Python

Dask

Pandas

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib / Seaborn

📁 Data Source
Our World in Data – COVID-19

📈 Key Insights
Countries with high stringency levels generally saw a flattening of case curves

Vaccination rollout varied significantly by region

Multiple correlations observed between policy response and pandemic trajectory

🚀 Getting Started
