# 🌌 Astroinformatics

Welcome to my personal cosmic library! ✨ This repository is a living, breathing record of my journey toward mastering **astroinformatics** — the thrilling frontier where data science meets the universe.

---

## 🚀 Mission

To build a strong, interdisciplinary foundation bridging:
- **Physics & Astrophysics** — understanding the forces that shape stars, galaxies, and the cosmic tapestry.
- **Chemistry & Astrochemistry** — uncovering the molecules that paint the universe and maybe hint at life beyond Earth.
- **Mathematics** — the universal language that underpins everything from planetary orbits to data algorithms.
- **Astronomy** — our window to the night sky, where we decipher cosmic mysteries one photon at a time.
- **Astrobiology** — exploring the tantalizing question: *Are we alone?*

All roads lead to **astroinformatics**, where we transform celestial data into cosmic insights.
