## 🌍 Chemistry

### Why it matters
Before we leap into the stars, we need to understand the elements and reactions right here on Earth. Chemistry is the foundation of life and technology.

### Topics covered
- **Atomic structure & periodic trends**  
- **Chemical bonding & molecular geometry**  
- **Thermodynamics & kinetics**  
- **Organic chemistry fundamentals**  
- **Spectroscopy & analytical techniques**

## 🌌 Astrochemistry

### What is astrochemistry?
The universe isn’t just stars and black holes. It's also brimming with complex chemistry. Astrochemistry studies molecules in space: how they form, evolve, and maybe hint at life elsewhere.

### Topics explored
- **Interstellar medium and molecular clouds**
- **Formation of organic molecules in space**
- **Ices and dust grains on comets and asteroids**
- **Spectral signatures of cosmic molecules**
- **Chemical evolution of star-forming regions**
